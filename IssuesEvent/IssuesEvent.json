      "body": "If an application or library uses liblzma and wishes the user to specify compression settings, it's currently too complicated to support any advanced settings like adding x86 BCJ filter. Currently such applications support just a preset level (integer 0-9). liblzma should have a string-to-filter-chain function. Then, for example, libarchive/bsdtar could let user specify a liblzma-specific string of compression options and pass that to liblzma as is.\r\n\r\nThe syntax to specify filter chains on the xz command line is likely a bit confusing. Using the above liblzma function in xz with  a new option would make the filter-chain specifications consistent between applications.",

When `lzma_options_lzma *` is used, it will cause an error.\r\n\r\nThe solution to this can be done either in code or in documentation. The code change would be simple to check if the needed match finders were configured.\r\n\r\nInstead, a documentation change in lzma12.h could make it clear that the preset is valid, but might not work depending on the liblzma configuration (in this case, which match finders were built).\n\n### Version\n\n5.5.0alpha\n\n### Operating System\n\nN/A\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_",

When `lzma_options_lzma *` is used, it will cause an error.\r\n\r\nThe solution to this can be done either in code or in documentation. The code change would be simple to check if the needed match finders were configured.\r\n\r\nInstead, a documentation change in lzma12.h could make it clear that the preset is valid, but might not work depending on the liblzma configuration (in this case, which match finders were built).\n\n### Version\n\n5.5.0alpha\n\n### Operating System\n\nN/A\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_",

      "body": "Hello!\r\n\r\nClang 16.0.0 and older report a warning when compiling a program that uses `__attribute__((__ifunc__()))` with `-Wunused-function`. The resolver function appears to trigger this when it is only referenced by the `__attribute__`. Here is an example program that should trigger the warning:\r\n\r\n```C\r\nstatic void resolved(void) {\r\n    return;\r\n}\r\n\r\nstatic void (*resolver (void)) (void) {\r\n\treturn resolved;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid indirect_function(void) __attribute__((__ifunc__(\"resolver\")));\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n    indirect_function();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nGCC does not issue a warning for the above program. [Here](https://godbolt.org/z/9f1TnjG7h) is a godbolt.org snippet of the above code to allow you to easily test it. Let me know if you need anymore information.",
