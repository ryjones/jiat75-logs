This also means\nthat a corrupt file cannot cause the raw decoder to process\nuseless extra input or output that would exceed the size info\nin Block Header (and thus cause LZMA_DATA_ERROR anyway).\n\nMore importantly, now the size information is verified more\ncarefully in case raw decoder returns LZMA_OK. This doesn't\nreally matter with the current single-threaded .xz decoder\nas the errors would be detected slightly later anyway. But\nthis helps avoiding corner cases in the upcoming threaded\ndecompressor, and it might help other Block decoder uses\noutside liblzma too.\n\nThe test files bad-1-lzma2-{9,10,11}.xz test these conditions.\nWith the single-threaded .xz decoder the only difference is\nthat LZMA_DATA_ERROR is detected in a difference place now.",

The LZMA avail_in value is unsigned, so it was treating the available in as a large positive number and trying to continue reading input. This resulted in the invalid read segmentation fault.  \r\n\r\nThis is a quick fix to the issue. I tested it on the file provided by [icycityone](https://github.com/icycityone) and it no longer segmentation faults. I am not sure if a deeper fix is needed to prevent zip->entry_bytes_remaining from being negative, but this will at least solve the problem in the short term. \r\n\r\nThank you to [icycityone](https://github.com/icycityone) for discovering and reporting this bug and thank you to Lasse Collin for discovering the source of the problem. \r\n\r\nfixes #1672 ",

      "body": "Based on the investigation done by Lasse Collin, the bug in #1672 is caused by the in_bytes variable being set to a negative number because zip->entry_bytes_remaining was negative. The LZMA avail_in value is unsigned, so it was treating the available in as a large positive number and trying to continue reading input. This resulted in the invalid read segmentation fault.  \r\n\r\nThis is a quick fix to the issue. I tested it on the file provided by [icycityone](https://github.com/icycityone) and it no longer segmentation faults. I am not sure if a deeper fix is needed to prevent zip->entry_bytes_remaining from being negative, but this will at least solve the problem in the short term. \r\n\r\nThank you to [icycityone](https://github.com/icycityone) for discovering and reporting this bug and thank you to Lasse Collin for discovering the source of the problem. \r\n\r\nfixes #1672 ",

        "message": "xzgrep: Fix escaping of malicious filenames (ZDI-CAN-16587).\n\nMalicious filenames can make xzgrep to write to arbitrary files\nor (with a GNU sed extension) lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\nxzgrep from XZ Utils versions up to and including 5.2.5 are\naffected. 5.3.1alpha and 5.3.2alpha are affected as well.\nThis patch works for all of them.\n\nThis bug was inherited from gzip's zgrep. gzip 1.12 includes\na fix for zgrep.\n\nThe issue with the old sed script is that with multiple newlines,\nthe N-command will read the second line of input, then the\ns-commands will be skipped because it's not the end of the\nfile yet, then a new sed cycle starts and the pattern space\nis printed and emptied. So only the last line or two get escaped.\n\nOne way to fix this would be to read all lines into the pattern\nspace first. However, the included fix is even simpler: All lines\nexcept the last line get a backslash appended at the end. To ensure\nthat shell command substitution doesn't eat a possible trailing\nnewline, a colon is appended to the filename before escaping.\nThe colon is later used to separate the filename from the grep\noutput so it is fine to add it here instead of a few lines later.\n\nThe old code also wasn't POSIX compliant as it used \\n in the\nreplacement section of the s-command. Using \\<newline> is the\nPOSIX compatible method.\n\nLC_ALL=C was added to the two critical sed commands. POSIX sed\nmanual recommends it when using sed to manipulate pathnames\nbecause in other locales invalid multibyte sequences might\ncause issues with some sed implementations. In case of GNU sed,\nthese particular sed scripts wouldn't have such problems but some\nother scripts could have, see:\n\n    info '(sed)Locale Considerations'\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered by:\ncleemy desu wayo working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative\n\nThanks to Jim Meyering and Paul Eggert discussing the different\nways to fix this and for coordinating the patch release schedule\nwith gzip.",

That isn't the calling style suggested by the\nliblzma example program 02_decompress.c so perhaps the usefulness\nof this feature is limited.\n\nAlso, it is possible to write such a loop so that it works\nwith the single-threaded decoder but not with the threaded\ndecoder even after this commit, or so that it works only if\nlzma_mt.timeout = 0.\n\nThe zlib tutorial <https://zlib.net/zlib_how.html> is a well-known\nexample of a loop where more input is read only when output isn't\nfull. Porting this as is to liblzma would work with the\nsingle-threaded decoder (if LZMA_CONCATENATED isn't used) but it\nwouldn't work with threaded decoder even after this commit because\nthe loop assumes that no more output is possible when it cannot\nread more input (\"if (strm.avail_in == 0) break;\"). This cannot\nbe fixed at liblzma side; the loop has to be modified at least\na little.\n\nI'm adding this in any case because the actual code is simple\nand short and should have no harmful side-effects in other\nsituations.",

So only the last line or two get escaped.\n\nOne way to fix this would be to read all lines into the pattern\nspace first. However, the included fix is even simpler: All lines\nexcept the last line get a backslash appended at the end. To ensure\nthat shell command substitution doesn't eat a possible trailing\nnewline, a colon is appended to the filename before escaping.\nThe colon is later used to separate the filename from the grep\noutput so it is fine to add it here instead of a few lines later.\n\nThe old code also wasn't POSIX compliant as it used \\n in the\nreplacement section of the s-command. Using \\<newline> is the\nPOSIX compatible method.\n\nLC_ALL=C was added to the two critical sed commands. POSIX sed\nmanual recommends it when using sed to manipulate pathnames\nbecause in other locales invalid multibyte sequences might\ncause issues with some sed implementations. In case of GNU sed,\nthese particular sed scripts wouldn't have such problems but some\nother scripts could have, see:\n\n    info '(sed)Locale Considerations'\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered by:\ncleemy desu wayo working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative\n\nThanks to Jim Meyering and Paul Eggert discussing the different\nways to fix this and for coordinating the patch release schedule\nwith gzip.",

So only the last line or two get escaped.\n\nOne way to fix this would be to read all lines into the pattern\nspace first. However, the included fix is even simpler: All lines\nexcept the last line get a backslash appended at the end. To ensure\nthat shell command substitution doesn't eat a possible trailing\nnewline, a colon is appended to the filename before escaping.\nThe colon is later used to separate the filename from the grep\noutput so it is fine to add it here instead of a few lines later.\n\nThe old code also wasn't POSIX compliant as it used \\n in the\nreplacement section of the s-command. Using \\<newline> is the\nPOSIX compatible method.\n\nLC_ALL=C was added to the two critical sed commands. POSIX sed\nmanual recommends it when using sed to manipulate pathnames\nbecause in other locales invalid multibyte sequences might\ncause issues with some sed implementations. In case of GNU sed,\nthese particular sed scripts wouldn't have such problems but some\nother scripts could have, see:\n\n    info '(sed)Locale Considerations'\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered by:\ncleemy desu wayo working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative\n\nThanks to Jim Meyering and Paul Eggert discussing the different\nways to fix this and for coordinating the patch release schedule\nwith gzip.",

        "message": "liblzma: Add optional autodetection of LZMA end marker.\n\nTurns out that this is needed for .lzma files as the spec in\nLZMA SDK says that end marker may be present even if the size\nis stored in the header. Such files are rare but exist in the\nreal world. The code in liblzma is so old that the spec didn't\nexist in LZMA SDK back then and I had understood that such\nfiles weren't possible (the lzma tool in LZMA SDK didn't\ncreate such files).\n\nThis modifies the internal API so that LZMA decoder can be told\nif EOPM is allowed even when the uncompressed size is known.\nIt's allowed with .lzma and not with other uses.\n\nThanks to Karl Beldan for reporting the problem.",

This bug was fixed in zgrep in gzip in 2012.\n\nAdd -E, -F, -G, and -P to the \"no argument required\" list.\n\nAdd -X to \"argument required\" list. It is an\nintentionally-undocumented GNU grep option so this isn't\nan important option for xzgrep but it seems that other grep\nimplementations (well, those that I checked) don't support -X\nso I hope this change is an improvement still.\n\ngrep -d (grep --directories=ACTION) requires an argument. In\ncontrast to zgrep, I kept -d in the \"no argument required\" list\nbecause it's not supported in xzgrep (or zgrep). This way\n\"xzgrep -d\" gives an error about option being unsupported instead\nof telling that it requires an argument.

        "message": "liblzma: Vaccinate against an ill patch from RHEL/CentOS 7.\n\nRHEL/CentOS 7 shipped with 5.1.2alpha, including the threaded\nencoder that is behind #ifdef LZMA_UNSTABLE in the API headers.\nIn 5.1.2alpha these symbols are under XZ_5.1.2alpha in liblzma.map.\nAPI/ABI compatibility tracking isn't done between development\nreleases so newer releases didn't have XZ_5.1.2alpha anymore.\n\nLater RHEL/CentOS 7 updated xz to 5.2.2 but they wanted to keep\nthe exported symbols compatible with 5.1.2alpha. After checking\nthe ABI changes it turned out that >= 5.2.0 ABI is backward\ncompatible with the threaded encoder functions from 5.1.2alpha\n(but not vice versa as fixes and extensions to these functions\nwere made between 5.1.2alpha and 5.2.0).\n\nIn RHEL/CentOS 7, XZ Utils 5.2.2 was patched with\nxz-5.2.2-compat-libs.patch to modify liblzma.map:\n\n  - XZ_5.1.2alpha was added with lzma_stream_encoder_mt and\n    lzma_stream_encoder_mt_memusage. This matched XZ Utils 5.1.2alpha.\n\n  - XZ_5.2 was replaced with XZ_5.2.2. It is clear that this was\n    an error; the intention was to keep using XZ_5.2 (XZ_5.2.2\n    has never been used in XZ Utils). So XZ_5.2.2 lists all\n    symbols that were listed under XZ_5.2 before the patch.\n    lzma_stream_encoder_mt and _mt_memusage are included too so\n    they are listed both here and under XZ_5.1.2alpha.\n\nThe patch didn't add any __asm__(\".symver ...\") lines to the .c\nfiles. Thus the resulting liblzma.so exports the threaded encoder\nfunctions under XZ_5.1.2alpha only. Listing the two functions\nalso under XZ_5.2.2 in liblzma.map has no effect without\nmatching .symver lines.\n\nThe lack of XZ_5.2 in RHEL/CentOS 7 means that binaries linked\nagainst unpatched XZ Utils 5.2.x won't run on RHEL/CentOS 7.\nThis is unfortunate but this alone isn't too bad as the problem\nis contained within RHEL/CentOS 7 and doesn't affect users\nof other distributions. It could also be fixed internally in\nRHEL/CentOS 7.\n\nThe second problem is more serious: In XZ Utils 5.2.2 the API\nheaders don't have #ifdef LZMA_UNSTABLE for obvious reasons.\nThis is true in RHEL/CentOS 7 version too. Thus now programs\nusing new APIs can be compiled without an extra #define. However,\nthe programs end up depending on symbol version XZ_5.1.2alpha\n(and possibly also XZ_5.2.2) instead of XZ_5.2 as they would\nwith an unpatched XZ Utils 5.2.2. This means that such binaries\nwon't run on other distributions shipping XZ Utils >= 5.2.0 as\nthey don't provide XZ_5.1.2alpha or XZ_5.2.2; they only provide\nXZ_5.2 (and XZ_5.0). (This includes RHEL/CentOS 8 as the patch\nluckily isn't included there anymore with XZ Utils 5.2.4.)\n\nBinaries built by RHEL/CentOS 7 users get distributed and then\npeople wonder why they don't run on some other distribution.\nSeems that people have found out about the patch and been copying\nit to some build scripts, seemingly curing the symptoms but\nactually spreading the illness further and outside RHEL/CentOS 7.\n\nThe ill patch seems to be from late 2016 (RHEL 7.3) and in 2017 it\nhad spread at least to EasyBuild. I heard about the events only\nrecently. :-(\n\nThis commit splits liblzma.map into two versions: one for\nGNU/Linux and another for other OSes that can use symbol versioning\n(FreeBSD, Solaris, maybe others). The Linux-specific file and the\nmatching additions to .c files add full compatibility with binaries\nthat have been built against a RHEL/CentOS-patched liblzma. Builds\nfor OSes other than GNU/Linux won't get the vaccine as they should\nbe immune to the problem (I really hope that no build script uses\nthe RHEL/CentOS 7 patch outside GNU/Linux).\n\nThe RHEL/CentOS compatibility symbols XZ_5.1.2alpha and XZ_5.2.2\nare intentionally put *after* XZ_5.2 in liblzma_linux.map. This way\nif one forgets to #define HAVE_SYMBOL_VERSIONS_LINUX when building,\nthe resulting liblzma.so.5 will have lzma_stream_encoder_mt@@XZ_5.2\nsince XZ_5.2 {...} is the first one that lists that function.\nWithout HAVE_SYMBOL_VERSIONS_LINUX @XZ_5.1.2alpha and @XZ_5.2.2\nwill be missing but that's still a minor problem compared to\nonly having lzma_stream_encoder_mt@@XZ_5.1.2alpha!\n\nThe \"local: *;\" line was moved to XZ_5.0 so that it doesn't need\nto be moved around. It doesn't matter where it is put.\n\nHaving two similar liblzma_*.map files is a bit silly as it is,\nat least for now, easily possible to generate the generic one\nfrom the Linux-specific file. But that adds extra steps and\nincreases the risk of mistakes when supporting more than one\nbuild system. So I rather maintain two files in parallel and let\nvalidate_map.sh check that they are in sync when \"make mydist\"\nis run.\n\nThis adds .symver lines for lzma_stream_encoder_mt@XZ_5.2.2 and\nlzma_stream_encoder_mt_memusage@XZ_5.2.2 even though these\nweren't exported by RHEL/CentOS 7 (only @@XZ_5.1.2alpha was\nfor these two). I added these anyway because someone might\nmisunderstand the RHEL/CentOS 7 patch and think that @XZ_5.2.2\n(@@XZ_5.2.2) versions were exported too.\n\nAt glance one could suggest using __typeof__ to copy the function\nprototypes when making aliases. However, this doesn't work trivially\nbecause __typeof__ won't copy attributes (lzma_nothrow, lzma_pure)\nand it won't change symbol visibility from hidden to default (done\nby LZMA_API()). Attributes could be copied with __copy__ attribute\nbut that needs GCC 9 and a fallback method would be needed anyway.\n\nThis uses __symver__ attribute with GCC >= 10 and\n__asm__(\".symver ...\") with everything else. The attribute method\nis required for LTO (-flto) support with GCC. Using -flto with\nGCC older than 10 is now broken on GNU/Linux and will not be fixed\n(can silently result in a broken liblzma build that has dangerously\nincorrect symbol versions). LTO builds with Clang seem to work\nwith the traditional __asm__(\".symver ...\") method.\n\nThanks to Boud Roukema for reporting the problem and discussing\nthe details and testing the fix.",

This is how it was\nsupposed to work since the beginning but this was broken by\nthe commit 231c3c7098f1099a56abb8afece76fc9b8699f05, that is,\na little before 5.0.0 was released. The buggy behavior displayed\na message, set exit status 1 (error), and xz didn't attempt to\nto decompress the file.\n\nThis doesn't matter today except for special builds that disable\nCRC64 or SHA-256 at build time (but such builds should be used\nin special situations only). The bug matters if new check type\nis added in the future and an old xz version is used to decompress\nsuch a file; however, it's likely that such files would use a new\nfilter too and an old xz wouldn't be able to decompress the file\nanyway.\n\nThe first hunk in the commit is the actual fix. The second hunk\nis a cleanup since LZMA_TELL_ANY_CHECK isn't used in xz.\n\nThere is a test file for unsupported check type but it wasn't\nused by test_files.sh, perhaps due to different behavior between\nxz and the simpler xzdec.",

A CLMUL-only build can be done by using\n-msse4.1 -mpclmul in CFLAGS and this will reduce the library\nsize since the generic implementation and its 8 KiB lookup table\nwill be omitted.\n\nOn 32-bit x86 this isn't used by default for now because by default\non 32-bit x86 the separate assembly file crc64_x86.S is used.\nIf --disable-assembler is used then this new CLMUL code is used\nthe same way as on 64-bit x86. However, a CLMUL-only build\n(-msse4.1 -mpclmul) won't omit the 8 KiB lookup table on\n32-bit x86 due to a currently-missing check for disabled\nassembler usage.\n\nThe configure.ac check should be such that the code won't be\nbuilt if something in the toolchain doesn't support it but\n--disable-clmul-crc option can be used to unconditionally\ndisable this feature.\n\nCLMUL speeds up decompression of files that have compressed very\nwell (assuming CRC64 is used as a check type). It is know that\nthe CLMUL code is significantly slower than the generic code for\ntiny inputs (especially 1-8 bytes but up to 16 bytes).

      "body": "If an application or library uses liblzma and wishes the user to specify compression settings, it's currently too complicated to support any advanced settings like adding x86 BCJ filter. Currently such applications support just a preset level (integer 0-9). liblzma should have a string-to-filter-chain function. Then, for example, libarchive/bsdtar could let user specify a liblzma-specific string of compression options and pass that to liblzma as is.\r\n\r\nThe syntax to specify filter chains on the xz command line is likely a bit confusing. Using the above liblzma function in xz with  a new option would make the filter-chain specifications consistent between applications.",
